Hi everyone, I hope you are doing very well and everything is going well for you.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.500
I am CLÉBERT Marc Tyson, 3rd year student in computer engineering at INUKA University in Haiti,

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
one of the members of the MEGA SCRIPTS CLUB PROGRAMMING group

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
and also the owner of Codons.

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Today I am making a video for you in which I will try to present my website to you in a way.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, Codons is a platform that I designed in order to help people who are interested in learning programming.

7
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
On this platform, you will have access to courses like

8
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.500
C

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.500
C++

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.500
C#

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.000
Java

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Python

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.200
PHP

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.000
JavaScript

15
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.000
ect...

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.500
But for now we are going to make it simple, we will start with the most basic languages ​​like HTML and CSS,

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.500
because it is these two languages ​​that will allow us to create a static website at least.

18
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Besides, I already have an HTML course on it, if you are interested, you can start taking it today.

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
So guys, for more information,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.500
I will be very happy to explain in more detail all the processes you need to follow to achieve your goal.
